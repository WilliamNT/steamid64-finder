# steamid64-finder
I needed something like this quickly, so I coded it. This is just a quick code, meaning that it can easily be full with things I forgot to consider.

# Info
You'll need to replace YOUR_STEAM_API_KEY with well... your Steam API key. You can get one here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

If everything goes well, you should get

{
   "response":{
      "steamid":"**STEAMID64**",
      "success":1
   }
}
